# FlashyLingo

A simple and fun flashcard application for language learning, built with Python and Tkinter.

## Description

FlashyLingo helps you learn new languages by presenting flashcards with words and their translations. It uses a spaced repetition approach, allowing you to mark words as "known" to gradually remove them from your study deck.

## Features

* Displays flashcards with French words and their English translations.
* Randomly selects words from a CSV file.
* Automatically flips cards after 3 seconds.
* Allows you to mark words as "known" to track your progress.
* Saves your progress to a CSV file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.12
* `pandas` library (install with `pip install pandas`)

### Usage

* The program will display a flashcard with a French word.
* After 3 seconds, the card will flip, showing the English translation.
* Click the "right" button if you know the word.
* Click the "wrong" button if you do not know the word.
* The Program will then load the next card.
